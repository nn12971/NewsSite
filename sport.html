                    After several years away from his pro wrestling carrier, 
                    he has returned to reclaim his title. On October 5th, he 
                    had his first match back and was once again the crowd 
                    favorite. Only a couple minutes later, he was banned from
                    wrestling premanently for severing a man's spine into 
                    three pieces. He has been charged with manslaughter and 
                    will be tried on the 17th of October. Refunds were given 
                    to all attendants of the event, and therapists will be 
                    provided for anyone who desires one.

                    Once thought dead, Muhammad Ali has mysteriously reappeared 
                    in boxing matches. He has supposedly been training nonstop 
                    since his "death" to become the best boxer he could be. He
                    has since knocked out 5 opponents within the first thirty
                    seconds of the fight.

        the information anyways. Not because we worked hard on 
        it, but because most of it is false. What do you expect 
        from a news channel? Anyways, we don't want to get in 
        trouble for you looking like an idiot. Thank you.
