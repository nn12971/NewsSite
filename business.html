                        Information has been leaked about Chick-fil-A recipes.
                        It has been confirmed that they do indeed use an
                        alternative meat in their chicken nuggets to cut 
                        costs. Chick-fil-A has been substituting their 
                        chicken based meals for cat meat.

                    YouTube has deleted the like button. After so much 
                    backlash from taking away the dislike counter, they
                    thought it would be funny to remove the like button
                    completely from their website.

        This website is not copyrighted, but please don't share 
        the information anyways. Not because we worked hard on 
        it, but because most of it is false. What do you expect 
        from a news channel? Anyways, we don't want to get in 
        trouble for you looking like an idiot. Thank you.
